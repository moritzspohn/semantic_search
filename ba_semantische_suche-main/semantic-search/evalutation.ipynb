The task at hand is to replicate a desired pattern, encoded in a photomask, on a photoresist-covered wafer. Recent decades have witnessed an impressive development of photolithographic equipment, enabling a resolution much finer than a micron.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potentially the simplest photolithographic tool is the mask aligner. It brings the photomask and the wafer in contact or close proximity, with no additional optics in between. Being introduced over 50~years ago, the cost-effective operation renders mask aligner lithography in proximity mode the method of choice for fabricating non-critical layers, with a spatial resolution down to several microns. Mask aligners are used for the manufacturing of microlenses, light emitting diodes, and microelectromechanical systems. The resolution is ultimately limited by diffraction of the exposure light at the photomask features, resulting in image shape distortions. \n",

      "In this work, several resolution enhancement techniques for mask aligners in proximity mode are successfully developed, presented, and discussed. This comprises photolithography using a novel light source emitting at deep ultraviolet wavelengths, a rigorously optimized phase-shifting mask to print periodic structures, optical proximity lithography applied to non-Manhattan geometries, and the design of optical metasurfaces for photomasks in proximity lithography. \n",

We successfully demonstrate lithographic prints of test structures with a resolution down to 1.75$\\,$µm at a proximity gap of 20$\\,$µm. Using the self-imaging effect of Talbot lithography, even sub-micron resolution for periodic structures is achieved.\n",

The superposition of individual plane waves illuminating the optimized photomask under three discrete angles allows a demagnification of the photomask period, enabling to print sub-micron structures at relaxed constraints on the photomask fabrication. Furthermore, we introduce a computational approach to optical proximity correction of non-rectangular geometries, so-called non-Manhattan geometries, thus increasing the pattern fidelity in proximity lithography.

      "\n",
      "This thesis presents a method for the comprehensive optical simulation of disordered scattering layers that can be used for light extraction in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).\n",
      "The method is accurate in the sense that it solves Maxwell's equations for dipole emission into a plane parallel system of layers including multiple scattering particles.\n",
      "To this end, the electromagnetic field is computed by means of an expansion in \\emph{spherical waves} (to treat the scattering by the individual particles) as well as in \\emph{plane waves} (for the propagation of the field through the OLED thin film system). \n",
      "\n",
      "After visiting the fundamentals of OLEDs and the issue of trapped light, the relevant multiple-scattering formulas are derived in an \\emph{excitation-response} notation. They allow the formulation of the scattering problem in terms of a linear system of equations for the scattered field coefficients, featuring the so called \\emph{T-matrix} to account for the scattering properties of the individual particles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Numerical aspects of an efficient assembly and solution of the linear system are discussed, and formulas to process the solution further into the relevant figures of merit (electric field distribution, dissipated dipole power, power flux through surfaces, far field intensity distribution) are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presented formalism has been implemented into a freely available software package, \\emph{Smuthi}. The program structure is sketched and the validity of the implementation is demonstrated by a comparison to finite-elements calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the simulation method is applied to a typical OLED light management scenario: it consists of a flat scattering layer integrated within a white OLED, whose planar layout and the location of the emission zones have been optimized beforehand to optimize the outcoupling efficiency. This way, a fair estimate for the gain in outcoupling efficiency through an internal scattering layer is provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is noted that the range of possible use cases for the presented theoretical formalism and for the software package is not limited to light extraction from OLEDs, but includes many other applications that involve particles near planar interfaces.\n",

      "The study presented here was initiated by a discussion to investigate the possibility of using synchrotron radiation as a source for the Next Generation Lithography (NGL) based on the EUV-concept (Extreme Ultra-Violet; here 13.5 nm or 11.3 nm radiation, respectively). The requirements are: 50 W, 2% bandwidth and minimal power outside this bandwidth. Three options were investigated. The first two deal with radiation from bending magnets and undulators. The results confirm the earlier work by Oxfords Instrument and others that these light-sources lack in-band power while emitting excessive out-of-band radiation. The third approach is a FEL (Free Electron Laser) driven by a 500 MeV linear accelerator with a superconducting mini-undulator as radiation emitting device. Such a device would produce in-band EUV-power in excess of 50 W with negligible out-of-band power.&nbsp;\n",

      "Robust Scalable Sorting\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorting is one of the most important basic algorithmic problems. Thus, it is not a surprise that sorting algorithms are needed in a very large number of applications. These applications are executed on a wide range of different machines–from smartphones with energy-efficient multi-core processors to supercomputers with thousands of machines interconnected by a high-performance network. Since single-core performance has stagnated, parallel applications have become an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Efficient and scalable algorithms are key to take advantage of this immense availability of (parallel) computing power. In this thesis, we study sequential and parallel sorting algorithms aiming at robust performance for a diverse set of input sizes, input distributions, data types, and machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first part of this thesis, we study sequential sorting as well as parallel sorting on shared-memory machines. We propose In-place Parallel Super Scalar Samplesort (IPS⁴o), a new comparison-based algorithm that is provably in-place, i.e., the amount of additional memory does not depend on the size of the input. An essential result is that the in-place property improves the performance of IPS⁴o compared to similar non-in-place algorithms. Until now, the in-place feature has usually been associated with a loss of speed for most algorithms. IPS⁴o is also provably cache-efficient and performs $O(n/t\\log n)$ work per thread when executed with $t$ threads. Additionally, IPS⁴o incorporates a branchless decision tree to minimize the number of branch mispredictions, takes advantage of memory locality, and handles many elements with equal keys–so-called duplicated keys–by separating them into \"equality buckets\". For the special case of sorting integer keys, we use the algorithmic framework of IPS⁴o to implement In-place Parallel Super Scalar Radix Sort (IPS²Ra).\n",
      "We validate the performance of our algorithms in an extensive experimental study involving 21 state-of-the-art sorting algorithms, six data types, ten input distributions, four machines, four memory allocation strategies, and input sizes varying over seven orders of magnitude. On the one hand, the study shows that our algorithms have consistently good performance. On the other hand, it reveals that many competitors have large performance issues: With IPS⁴o, we obtain a robust comparison-based sorting algorithm that outperforms other parallel in-place comparison-based sorting algorithms by almost a factor of three. In the large majority of the cases, IPS⁴o is the fastest comparison-based algorithm. At this point, it is irrelevant whether we compare IPS⁴o to sequential or parallel, in-place or non-in-place algorithms. IPS⁴o even outperforms competing implementations of integer sorting algorithms in many cases. The remaining cases mainly include uniformly distributed inputs and inputs with keys containing only few bits. These inputs are usually \"easy\" for integer sorting algorithms. Our integer sorter IPS²Ra outperforms other integer sorting algorithms for these inputs in the large majority of the cases. Exceptions are some very small inputs for which most of the algorithms are very inefficient. However, algorithms dedicated for these input sizes are usually much slower for the remaining range of input sizes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the second part of this thesis, we study sorting algorithms for distributed systems and their robust scalability with regard to the number of processors, the input size, duplicated keys, and the distribution of input keys to processors. Our main contributions are four robust scalable sorting algorithms that allow us to cover the entire range of input sizes. Three of the four are new fast algorithms that implement low overhead mechanisms to make them scale robustly regardless of \"difficult\" inputs, e.g., inputs where the location of the input elements is correlated to the key values–so-called skewed element distributions–or inputs with duplicated keys. The fourth algorithm is simple and may be considered as folklore.\n",
      "Previous algorithms for inputs of medium and large size have an unacceptably large communication volume or an unacceptably large number of message exchanges. For these input sizes, we describe a robust multi-level generalization of samplesort that represents a feasible compromise between a moderate communication volume and a moderate number of message exchanges. We overcome these previously incompatible goals with scalable approximate splitter selection and a new data routing algorithm. As an alternative, we present a generalization of mergesort with the advantage of perfect load balance. For small inputs, we design a variant of quicksort that overcomes the problem of skewed element distributions and duplicated keys with fast high-quality pivot selection, element randomization, and low overhead duplicate handling. Previous practical approaches with polylogarithmic latency either have at least a logarithmic factor more communication or only consider uniform input. For very small inputs, we propose a practical and fast, yet work-inefficient algorithm with logarithmic latency. For these inputs, previous efficient approaches are theoretical algorithms mostly with prohibitively large constant factors. For the smallest inputs, we recommend an algorithm that sorts the data while the input is routed to a single processor.\n",
      "An important contribution of this thesis to the practical side of algorithm engineering is a communication library that we call RangeBasedComm (RBC). RBC allows an efficient implementation of recursive algorithms with sublinear running time by providing scalable and efficient communication primitives on processor subsets. The RBC library significantly speeds up the algorithms, e.g., one competitor even by more than two orders of magnitude.\n",
      "We present an extensive experimental study involving two supercomputers with up to 262144 cores, 11 algorithms, 10 input distributions, and input sizes varying over nine orders of magnitude. For all but the largest input sizes, we are the only ones performing benchmarks on these large machine instances. The study also shows that our algorithms have a robust performance and outperform competing implementations significantly. Whereas our algorithms provide consistent performance on all inputs, our competitors' performance breaks down on \"difficult\" inputs or they literally break.\n",

      "Modeling Optical Metamaterials with Strong Spatial Dispersion\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Optical metamaterials are artificial media made from subwavelength inclusions with unconventional properties at optical frequencies. While a response to the magnetic field of light in natural material is absent, metamaterials prompt to lift this limitation and to exhibit a response to both electric and magnetic fields at optical frequencies. Due to the interplay of both the actual shape of the inclusions and the material from which they are made, but also from the specific details of their arrangement, the response can be driven to one or multiple resonances within a desired frequency band. With such a high number of degrees of freedom, tedious trial-and-error simulations and costly experimental essays are inefficient when considering optical metamaterials in the design of specific applications. Therefore, to be able to discuss metamaterials on equal footing as natural materials and to consider them in the design of functional applications, the homogenization of optical materials is of utmost importance. Such effective description consists of mapping the optical response of an actual metamaterial to a set of spatially averaged, effective material parameters of a continuum. This step requires that the building blocks from which the metamaterials are made of are small and arranged with sufficient density in space in comparison to the operating wavelength. \n",
      "\n",
      "Often, local material laws have been considered in this mapping process, i.e., metamaterials are frequently modelled at the effective, i.e. the homogeneous level, by an electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and in case of optical activity, terms that express magneto-electric coupling. Such description is borrowed from natural materials at optical frequencies, where the characteristic length scale is in the subnanometer range. Metamaterials, however, possess a characteristic length that is only slightly smaller than the wavelength of light. Thus, the spatial variations of the fields begin to become important and a local description is not enough to adequately describe the metamaterial at the effective level. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this thesis, we lift this limitation and consider nonlocal constitutive relations in the homogenization process for a realistic modelling of optical metamaterials. Nonlocality means that the effective response of a material at every point depends on the fields of light at some distant points or, alternatively, on spatial derivatives of the fields at the same point, or both. We focus on periodic metamaterials with centrosymmetric unit cells with a non-negligible period-to-wavelength ratio and show the importance of retaining nonlocality in the effective description of metamaterials.\n",
      "\n",
      "After introducing the necessary mathematical background, we discuss the physical origin of nonlocality, which in the spatial Fourier domain translates to spatial dispersion, i.e., to a generalized permittivity that depends on the wave vector of light. This can lead to an artificial magnetic response and ultimately to a negative effective index of refraction, and even beyond. Then, the aforementioned generalized permittivity is expanded into a Taylor polynomial of the wave vector up to the fourth order. Dispersion relations describing light propagation in bulk metamaterials that are characterized by such constitutive relations are derived. We discuss the additional mode that emerges with nonlocality. We further, derive the appropriate interface conditions from first principles, in order to study how light couples from one media to another. With the interface conditions at hand, the Fresnel matrices, which ultimately allow us to analytically derive the reflection and transmission coefficients from a slab, are derived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we apply this formalism to three metamaterial examples. We show that a nonlocal description captures the properties of actual metamaterials much more accurate than the ordinary local description. Based on the scattering parameter retrieval, the effective material parameters are retrieved from different structures, where the referential reflection and transmission coefficients are numerically calculated with a very high precision. In the first example, we studied an all-dielectric and isotropic material made of an array of spheres arranged in a cubic lattice. We find that the optical features such as the presence of the Brewster angle are better captured with a nonlocal description, especially at frequencies close to the first photonic band gap. In the second example, we investigated the fishnet metamaterial. It has a negative effective refractive index in the studied frequency range. We find that a nonlocal description allows to predict the optical properties at oblique incidence, where a local description failed to do so. Further, in the retrieved effective material parameters within the local approach, an unphysical anti-Lorentzian in the permittivity arises. This could be lifted when a nonlocal description is considered. In the third and last example, we studied a wire medium structure, that is a prototypical metamaterial that supports a nonlocal optical response. For this material, a phenomenological approach with nonlocality already exists. We first show that the existing model fundamentally differs from the nonlocal model we have been proposing in this thesis, which suggests that homogenization is not unique and multiple models for an effective description may be used to explain the optical response of a specific metamaterial.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finalize this work by showing the limits of homogenization, and the drawbacks of the proposed retrieval method.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, we demonstrate that the nonlocal constitutive relations can describe the optical response much better than local constitutive relations would do. The general formulation we choose here can be extended to other kinds of nonlocal constitutive relations and renders our approach applicable to a wide class of centrosymmetric metamaterials.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The axion is a well-motivated dark matter (DM) candidate which has its origin in Peccei and Quinn's solution for the strong $\\mathrm{CP}$ problem. In the present work, we study phenomenological implications of axion DM that mainly originate from its cosmological evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "We especially focus on scenarios where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is broken after inflation. Here, we expect large isocurvature fluctuations in the axion energy density. These can eventually collapse into gravitationally bound objects, called miniclusters. By calculating the mass function of the axion miniclusters, we are for the first time able to give predictions on their distribution in mass and size. We find for a QCD axion with mass $m_a\\sim \\mu\\mathrm{eV}$, a typical minicluster mass of $\\sim 10^{-13}M_{\\odot}$ and size of $\\sim 10^6~\\mathrm{km}$.\n",
      "\n",
      "By numerically simulating the actual collapse of the axion overdensities after they decouple from the Hubble expansion, we also consider the equilibrium state of the axion miniclusters. Namely, a so far open question is if the miniclusters collapse into a static axion star configuration or rather form dilute virialized clouds. In fact, we find hints for the latter and it seems that after a short period of violent collapse the miniclusters take a quite dilute state which is characterized by an oscillating ratio of kinetic to potential energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another part, we consider the effects of the axion isocurvature fluctuations on cosmological large-scale observables, like the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It turns out that these become only important for ultra-light axion-like particles (ULAs). Using observations of the CMB primary anisotropy spectrum we can show that due to these effects ULA DM with masses in a range $10^{-24}~\\mathrm{eV}-10^{-15}~\\mathrm{eV}$ can be strongly constrained. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, we also briefly review the experimental possibilities for axion detection experiments. For example, it is known that in a strong electromagnetic field, the DM axion background field can induce tiny electric and magnetic fields. In an appendix of the present work, we discuss a quantum field calculation of these induced fields with the main focus on the impact of the spatial size of the applied field in comparison to the axion Compton wavelength.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stratospheric aerosol, in which sulphur is by far the most common element, has the potential to exhibit a cooling effect on Earth surface temperatures by backscattering incoming solar radiation. This potential, and an increased stratospheric aerosol loading during the last decade, caused rising interest in stratospheric sulphur during the last years.\n",
      "The main precursors of stratospheric sulphate aerosol are gaseous carbonyl sulphide (OCS) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). From MIPAS/Envisat (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding aboard the Environmental Satellite), data sets of OCS and SO2 are available for Jul 2002–Apr 2012. This work is based on the mentioned data sets of OCS and SO2, and additionally on a new data set of MIPAS aerosol volume densities that has been studied in this thesis for the first time. In the course of this thesis, the new data set has been improved by identifying and deselecting data that were influenced by other types of aerosol than sulphate aerosol. By validation with coincident balloon-borne data, MIPAS profiles have been shown to be in good agreement with the in situ measurements after applying an altitude-dependent offset-correction. This correction is based on the comparison between MIPAS and in situ aerosol volume density profiles.\n",
      "In an isentropic chemical transport model (CTM) a sulphur scheme has been implemented with the purpose to test consistency between the sulphur species measured by MIPAS with the aid of model simulations, and to test if this is in line with our current understanding. In a case study on the volcanic eruptions of Kasatochi in 2008 and Sarychev in 2009, which both erupted during boreal summer at ~50°N, consistency between MIPAS SO2 and sulphate aerosol could be demonstrated in terms of volcanic mass and transport patterns. Calculations of e-folding lifetimes of stratospheric volcanic sulphur after the eruption of Sarychev resulted in average lifetimes of roughly three months. While sedimentation plays an important role, especially in the peak amounts of volcanic sulphate aerosol and the sulphur that remains in the model on the long-term, sensitivity simulations with the CTM show that the dominant process governing the lifetime of sulphur in the extra-tropical lower stratosphere after the two eruptions was transport by the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Additionally, parts of the emitted sulphur were transported towards the Equator where they were lifted in the tropical pipe.\n",
      "Several patterns of primarily non-volcanic stratospheric sulphur seen in the MIPAS data, such as decrease of OCS in the stratosphere by photolysis, or formation of SO2 from OCS in the Tropics at ~25–35 km, could be confirmed by model simulations. Some patterns that are seen in the new MIPAS aerosol data, such as elevated sulphur mole-fractions in the Tropics at above 22 km, extending towards lower altitudes at high-latitudes, could be ascribed to sulphur released from OCS. In terms of stratospheric sulphur mass, consistency has been demonstrated between the MIPAS data sets of OCS, SO2 and liquid-phase H2SO4. Simulations of background conditions with OCS as the only sulphur source, in combination with simulations of volcanic sulphur with a relatively high frequency of volcanic injections (98 individual identified eruptions within approximately 10 years), can explain the stratospheric sulphur masses which were derived from MIPAS retrievals. Under background conditions, modelled sedimentation of sulphate aerosol is a main factor of uncertainty, with relatively strong impact on the absolute amounts of sulphate aerosol. Finally, the importance of relatively small and medium sized volcanic contributions as the main source of short-term to decadal scale variability over the MIPAS period has been illustrated.\n",

      "Optimization Strategies for Spatio-temporal Groundwater Dynamics Monitoring\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spatially continuous data play an essential role in hydrogeology for scientific research, risk assessment, and water management decision-making. However, most of this information is collected only selectively through measurements at groundwater monitoring wells and then regionalized. The predictive accuracy of these regionalized data, which usually provide the foundation for subsequent analysis and decision-making processes, depends on the design of the groundwater monitoring network (GMN), i.e., the spatial distribution, the monitoring density, the sampling frequency, as well as the interpolation technique and the interaction of these factors. This leads to a considerable optimization potential for the GMN and the regionalization technique. Appropriate GMNs are therefore important tools for the sustainable management and protection of groundwater resources. They provide access points for monitoring groundwater levels and sampling, thereby providing insight into groundwater conditions. Due to the combination of high initial investment and relatively low spatial representativeness of wells due to hydrogeologic heterogeneity, planning a suitable GMN is a major challenge. This work addresses techniques for better understanding groundwater dynamics through (i) spatial and (ii) spatiotemporal optimization of groundwater level monitoring networks (GLMNs) and (iii) more accurate spatial prediction of data obtained at these monitoring wells, employing interpolation techniques. For this purpose, the first part of this work comprises a comprehensive assessment of the most frequently applied deterministic and geostatistical, uni- and multivariate interpolation techniques for groundwater contour mapping in a study area characterized by a complex interaction between karst and an alluvial aquifer and the low-permeability strata of the Subalpine Molasse sediments. The studied methods were evaluated by global crossvalidation and eco-hydrogeologic information at karst springs, wetlands, surface waters, and profile sections. The potential effect of the choice of interpolation method on subsequent calculations was made by estimating the exchange processes between karst and alluvial aquifers based on the calculated potential differences. The results show that the choice of method, especially in the case of inadequate monitoring design, can have drastic effects on further analyses. This study showed that geostatistical or kriging interpolation methods were superior to deterministic interpolation methods. When groundwater data are sparse, co-kriging with spatially cross-correlated secondary variables (e.g., elevation, river level) that are sampled more frequently can provide meaningful information about the primary variable and thus reduce the variance of the estimation error. In the second part of this work, different GLMN designs with varying monitoring densities were investigated using numerically modeled groundwater surfaces with a range of scales and dynamics. The objective was to provide insight into appropriate monitoring approaches for reliable spatial estimation of groundwater levels (GWLs) and derive the monitoring density at which a proper information/cost ratio is achieved. The interpolation results were evaluated using global cross-validation and the actual spatial error, computed from the numerical model surfaces as “a priori” references. Monitoring networks with regular grid arrangements provided the most accurate spatial predictions for the density spectrum studied but are not suitable due to their drawbacks, such as a lack of extensibility. Comparably good performance was obtained when the maximum kriging prediction standard error was used as a selection criterion for the selection of new well locations to existing networks. In addition, a novel optimization strategy for GMN based on mathematical quasi-random sequences was applied in this study. The approach also produced good results and offers several advantages. No prior knowledge of the aquifer through existing wells is required, and reproducible designs are obtained independently of the expansion steps. In part three, a data-driven sparse sensing algorithm approach for selecting sparse sensor placements utilizing dimensionality reduction techniques was explored and adjusted for the temporal and spatial optimization of an existing GLMN in the Upper Rhine Graben. The optimization was performed by using a greedy search (QR) algorithm that selects and ranks monitoring wells according to their information content about aquifer dynamics. First, long-term hydrograph records were used as input data to indicate representative monitoring wells or wells with redundant or low information content. Second, optimization based on regionalized, weekly gridded GWL contour maps was performed to identify eligible locations for additional wells. This search was controlled with a spatial cost function that penalized less suitable sites. The approach studied has proven to be a potentially valuable tool for optimizing the number of wells and their locations, for network downsizing and expansion, or both combined.\n",

      "Bioreplicated Light-Harvesting Layers for Photovoltaics\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hierarchical micro-/nanotextures, which adorn the petal surfaces of a majority of flowering plant species, have been reported to often exhibit outstanding sunlight-capturing as well as self-cleaning properties. Both of these qualities can be exploited for photovoltaics (PV) via direct replication methods capable of transferring the multi-scale surface structure of a respective flower petal into transparent polymeric materials and onto the front surfaces of solar panels. In recent years, polymer casting and soft-imprint nanolithography have been the most widely used methods for directly copying (artificial as well as) natural micro-, nano-, and multi-scale-structures into an adequate technical material such as a polymer in order to exploit their highly optimized optical and/or wetting properties for optoelectronic devices. However, for large-scale applications, these methods have so far been hampered by the nature-given size limitations immanent in flower petals and by the limited number of high-quality soft-imprint replicas that can be produced from a single (polymeric) mold.\n",
      "Part of this contribution is dedicated to overcoming both these issues by demonstrating an upscaled bioreplication approach for the hierarchical surface structure of rose petals based on static hot-embossing lithography using metallic mold inserts, thereby paving the way towards a high-throughput production of high-quality replicas of plant surface structures on relevant length scales. After the careful assembly of several natural rose petals into gapless arrays, mechanically stable, temperature resistant, and large-area nickel mold inserts are fabricated based on these upscaled templates by utilizing nickel electroforming. Subsequently, upscaled polymeric replicas are produced from these molds via hot-embossing lithography using three different free-standing thermoplastic foil materials, namely poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). A high replication fidelity from the sub-micron to the centimeter scale while reaching continuously structured areas of up to 12.5 cm×10.0 cm per replica is demonstrated for all three polymer materials considered.\n",
      "Using such hot-embossed rose petal replicas as cover layers of copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) solar cells, efficient antireflection and light-trapping properties are observed for a broad spectral range and especially for oblique incidence angles above 50°. For normal light incidence, rose petal textured PMMA foils are even shown to reduce reflection losses more effectively than state-of-the-art magnesium fluoride (MgF2) thin-film antireflective layers. Experimental characterizations of the opto-electrical performance of high-efficiency CIGS single solar cells with various cover layer configurations confirm this trend, resulting in an average increase in device efficiency of 5.7%±0.6% for CIGS solar cells covered with PMMA rose petal replicas, while MgF2 antireflective coatings are found to induce an average performance gain of 4.5%±1.6% relative to the respective device efficiencies before applying the antireflective coatings.\n",
      "It is further demonstrated that, without any additional surface treatment, hot-embossed rose petal replicas can reach strong hydrophobicity with a static water contact angle of 134.4°±4.3° by employing the low surface free energy polymer FEP in the thermal imprinting routine. Experiments with water droplets falling onto tilted FEP rose petal replicas further highlight a pronounced water repellency and indicate their potential for introducing self-cleaning properties in PV devices.\n",
      "The performance gain induced by applying upscaled PMMA rose petal replicated light-harvesting layers is also assessed for 10 cm×10 cm silicon-based as well as CIGS mini-modules under realistic operational conditions for fixed installations with various module orientations and tilt angles over a period of nine months in Karlsruhe, Germany. Under conditions where much direct sunlight reaches the modules under oblique incidence angles, daily gains in energy yield relative to a planar cover layer configuration may reach exceptionally high values even well above 10%. Accelerated aging and abrasion tests following several standardized testing protocols widely used throughout the PV industry further promote the long-term applicability of PMMA rose petal replicated PV light-harvesting layers under outdoor conditions.\n",
      "Moreover, the efficient light-harvesting properties of typical petal surface structures on thin-film solar cells are analyzed in more detail by utilizing a specially developed 3D microstructure modeling routine and a combination of Monte-Carlo ray-tracing simulations and transfer-matrix calculations, mostly with a view on the impact of structural disorder on light in-coupling. Irrespective of the degree of disorder in height, positioning, or tilt angle of the petal-epidermal-cell-mimicking micro-cones, it is shown that the angle-dependent reflectance of such microstructures is mainly governed by the average aspect ratio of the micro-cones, and secondly by their average packing density.\n",
      "Lastly, the polarization properties of light reflected from solar panels and its harmful impact on populations of polarotactic water-seeking insects are studied. Typical glass-encapsulated PV modules inadvertently attract various species of water-seeking insects through the linearly polarized light they reflect from their smooth surfaces (the degree of linear polarization depends on the incidence/observation angle, and full linear polarization is observed under Brewster’s angle), which may cause a misidentification of solar panels as bodies of water and thereby lead to harmful impacts on the entomofauna. Field experiments studying the maladaptive attractiveness of rose petal replicated PMMA layers to polarotactic mayflies (Ephemeroptera: Ephemera danica) and horseflies (Diptera: Tabanidae) demonstrate nearly zero harmful attractiveness of rose petal replicated PMMA surfaces to both polarotactic insect species considered. This observation is linked to the optical properties of microstructured surfaces on the basis of imaging polarimetric measurements as well as Monte-Carlo ray-tracing simulations.\n",

This type of systems is numerically very challenging to treat since the solutions are highly oscillatory in space and time. The goal is to derive suitable analytical and numerical approximations. Based on the classical slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA), an improved error estimate is proven for this analytical approximation. The envelope equation avoids oscillations in space, making this approximation attractive for numerical computations. Furthermore, more accurate analytical approximations are obtained by extending the ansatz of the SVEA. In addition to the analytical study of the SVEA two numerical time integrators are constructed and analyzed without any step-size restrictions. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.<br>\n",

The construction and analysis of such polarized solutions is done using modulated Fourier expansions. This approach includes higher harmonics and yields approximations to polarized solutions that are of arbitrary order in the small parameter, going well beyond the known first-order approximation via a nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The given construction of polarized solutions is explicit, uses in addition a linear Schrödinger equation for each further order of approximation, and is accessible to direct numerical approximation.\n",

      "We study a system composed of a hydrogen atom interacting with an infinite conductor wall. The interaction energy decays like $L^{- 3}$ , where is the distance between the atom and the wall, due to the emergence of the van der Waals forces. In this paper we show how, considering the contributions from the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, the interaction is weakened to a decay of order L ́4 giving rise to the retardation effects which fall under the name of Casimir-Polder effect. The analysis is done by studying a suitable Pauli-Fierz model associated to the system, in dipole approximation and reduced to the interaction with 0 and 1 photon\n",

      "We propose a novel variant of the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD) method for time-harmonic scattering problems of Helmholtz type with high wavenumber $\\kappa$. On a coarse mesh of width $H$, the proposed method identifies local finite element source terms that yield rapidly decaying responses under the solution operator. They can be constructed to high accuracy from independent local snapshot solutions on patches of width $\\ell H$ and are used as problem-adapted basis functions in the method. In contrast to the classical LOD and other state-of-the-art multi-scale methods, the localization error decays super-exponentially as the oversampling parameter $\\ell$ is increased. This implies that optimal convergence is observed under the substantially relaxed over-sampling condition $\\ell\\gtrsim(\\log \\frac{\\kappa}{H})^{(d-1)/d}$ with $d$ denoting the spatial dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significantly improved offline and online performance of the method also in the case of heterogeneous media and perfectly matched layers.\n",

      "Particle accelerators exist in different variants serving different purposes in scientific, industrial and medical applications. In the field of high energy physics, hadron colliders are often seen as “exploration machines” and lepton colliders as facilities for precise measurements of the particles. The Large-Hadron-Collider (LHC) is such a hadron collider at which the Higgs boson was found, that couldn’t be characterized completely [et.20], yet. It is a storage ring collider where the colliding particles are accelerated in forward direction by the radio frequency cavities and perpendicularly, to form a closed ring, by bending magnets. This results in strong radiation, called synchrotron radiation named after the synchrotron circular accelerator in which it was discovered [et.20]. For colliders of light particles this is a big disadvantage and was one of the limiting factors of LHC’s predecessor, the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP), because the radiation power losses scale with 1/m4 [Hue, Wie07]. Hence, there are concepts for linear colliders as the next large high energy physics experiment machine, namely the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) [Eur20, The18].\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the synchrotron radiation can also be used for scientific purposes. Nowadays, dedicated synchrotrons exist that utilise this broadband and intense light. The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) has got a storage ring called KArlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) providing its radiation for a variety of use cases ranging from imaging with hard x-rays to lithography, and THz and infrared spectroscopy [ANK14].\n",
      "Modern synchrotron light sources make use of insertion devices (ID) that provide much higher intensities than bending magnets do. One kind of such an ID is a so-called wiggler. Its spectrum is similar broadband as that of a bending magnet, but much stronger enabling hard x-ray imaging at KARA’s IMAGE beamline. Though in general synchrotron radiation is not wanted at high energy physics accelerators,\n",
      "the next generation of colliders will make use of it, too. They produce it on purpose before accelerating the beam to its final energy to actively reduce the transverse momentum. Thereby the luminosity and thus the statistics of the collision processes can be increased.\n",
      "For this purpose very strong wigglers, then called damping wiggler, are used. For the CLIC project it is planned to have two damping rings each with two straight sections with 26 2-m-long superconducting wiggler with a magnetic field of 3 T and a period length of 0.05 m [The18] each. The layout of the CLIC facility and one damping ring is sketched in Fig. 1.1. After the injection and pre-acceleration the electron beams’ oscillations are damped in the pre damping rings (labelled PDR in the figure) and damping rings (DR) with the damping wigglers, before the beams are longitudinally compressed (in BC1, BC2), guided (in TA, BDS), and accelerated (in booster linac, main linac) untill they collide in the interaction point (IP). A novel cooling technique for superconducting wigglers was developed by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP) to make individual wigglers more accessible to maintenance by using conduction cooling instead of bath cooling. This and the expected high heat load from the upstream wigglers are challenging for devices with these high fields and relatively short period length. Also, damping rings with superconducting wigglers have not been built yet, so the demand to test a prototype of such a wiggler emerged. The Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN), the KIT and the BINP have established a collaboration to investigate the maturity of the technology and to investigate beam dynamic effects caused by a prototype of such a wiggler build by BINP and installed in KARA. The wiggler serves as a prototype for CERN and as a light source for KIT’s IMAGE beamline at KARA.\n",
      "In this thesis, the question if damping wigglers can be used in such large scale, as planned for damping rings, will be tackeled. Can the beam dynamics of the wigglers be simulated properly and can the effects be experimentally confirmed? Or does it turn out that beam dynamics of damping wigglers are not understood sufficiently well to rely the next generation collider physics accelerators thereon when ca. 50 % of the damping rings’ circumference are damping wigglers? Can one find effects appearing in real devices that are not covered by simulations so far? These are questions, this thesis tries to answer by simulating the damping wiggler prototype and doing measurements with it in KARA. For the CLIC project emerging from a conceptual design study to a technical design study it is of interest if this prototype can fulfill the expectations and work reliably in a real accelerator. This is the topic of this thesis. As collective effects showed to be of importance for the CLIC damping rings [The18] in the past, it is also of interest to do first experiments with this wiggler with regard to collective effects. At KARA there is also a strong research on one collective effect, the so-called “micro-bunching instability” which is under investigation in theory, simulation and experiments. Therefore it makes sense to experimentally investigate the wiggler’s influence on this particular collective effect within this work.\n",
      "After the necessary theoretical background on accelerator physics, beam dynamics, synchrotron radiation and insertion devices—in Chapter 2—, the experimental setup of the accelerator and its insertion devices and then the simulation and measurement techniques are presented in Chapter 3. Because often IDs are simulated as many alternating dipoles or quadrupoles only acting in the vertical plane no common approach exists that satisfies our needs for the simulation, in particular higher order multipoles represented in actual field data. So different approaches for including the wiggler into the storage ring models are evaluated and compared against each other. This encompasses, firstly, the transformation of magnetic field data to Fourier components as input for different wiggler implementation of the particle tracking code elegant. And, secondly, the selection of the actual implementation of the wiggler model. The available options and choices made will be discussed in Chapter 4. The basic functionality, features and influence of the wiggler on beam dynamics are tested experimentally in the 2.50 GeV operation mode. In this mode also heat load studies were conducted. Some further beam dynamics investigations and experiments were carried out in the short-bunch, low-α mode at 1.30 GeV beam-energy to better understand the mechanisms of coherent synchrotron radiation and the so-called micro-bunching instability.\n",
      "Accordingly, the development of two different models of the storage ring is presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 describes the experimental characterisation of the wiggler. This includes the findings of the heat load studies as well as the beam dynamics investigations that yielded additional octupole components of the integrated magnetic field. The wiggler was not only used to investigate its transverse beam dynamics, but it was also used to investigate the influence of the damping time on the THz radiation emitted by the electron beam. This happened in the special short-bunch, low-α mode. The optics manipulation needed to operate the wiggler in this special operation mode along with the experimental results of these efforts are presented in Chapter 7.\n",
